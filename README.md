##🚀 Log Analytics Engine
Software applications generate a continuous stream of logs that provide insight into how a system is running. These logs allow engineers to track system health, identify unusual behavior, troubleshoot issues, and understand performance over time. Turning this raw log data into meaningful information is an important part of maintaining reliable systems.

This project demonstrates a simple end-to-end logging pipeline that mimics a real-world workflow. It simulates realistic log data, processes and organizes it into a structured format, and presents the results through an interactive dashboard. The aim is to show how logs can be collected, transformed, and visualized in a clear and modular way.
